# Particle Tracking in Plasma Sheet

This project implements a simulation to track the motion of charged particles (electrons and protons) in dynamically varying electromagnetic fields. It uses field data from RCM runs, interpolates it onto a common grid, and applies Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) integration to compute particle trajectories. The results are saved and visualized using Python libraries.

# Features
## Field Data Loading and Preprocessing
Reads field data files (datapot.dat) and splits them into chunks based on time intervals.
Interpolates fields onto a common grid for consistent analysis.
## Particle Initialization
Generates initial positions for electrons and protons within specified radial and angular ranges.
Ensures particles are placed with a minimum distance constraint if enabled.
## Velocity Computation
Computes total velocities (V_tot) for particles by combining gradient-curvature drift and ExB drift velocities.
## Trajectory Calculation
Tracks particles using RK4 integration. Stops particles when they exit a predefined elliptical boundary.
## Visualization
Plots PV_gamma maps overlaid with particle positions and velocities. Highlights particles with color-coded markers based on their energy (landa values).
## Data Storage
Saves particle tracking results and field properties in an HDF5 file (tracking_results.h5).
# Installation
## Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
## Libraries
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
h5py
## Install the required libraries using pip
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy h5py
# Usage
## Run the Simulation
## Execute the script directly
python particle_tracking.py
## Input Files
Ensure the field data file (datapot.dat) is placed in the directory:
/../RCM_out/

The field data should inlcude:
XMIN  YMIN  VM  BMIN  V  PV_gamma  Vx_exb  Vy_exb  

## Output
The processed data, particle trajectories, and plots are saved in the desired directory:
/../BT_out/
